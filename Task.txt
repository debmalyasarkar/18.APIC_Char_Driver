      
Implement char driver that supports open, release, and ioctl operations 
on Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller(IOAPIC).

Implement ioctl Operations for the following

1. APIC_GETID           : returns identification no of Apic
2. APIC_GETIRQS         : returns no of irq pins on APIC
3. APIC_GETIRQSTATUS    : returns irq pin status (enabled, disabled)
4: APIC_GETIRQTYPE      : returns irq pin signal type

Write a test application to initiate and verify above commands.

Write two versions of the code for:
1.VFS
2.SYSFS
